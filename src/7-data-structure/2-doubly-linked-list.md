# Doubly Linked List
- It consists of nodes where each node has a value and two pointers that points to previous or next node or null.
- It consists of **head**, **tail** and **length** property to keep track of lists.
- Like any array, there are no indexes in the list. So, it can't be accessed through index
- It is a bi-directional, that mean a node has knowledge of previous and next nodes
