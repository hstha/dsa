# Data Structure
- Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Why are there so many data structures?
  - Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

## Why we care about data structures?
  - The more time you spend as a developer. the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures. Because, there is a point of time where we need efficient type of data structure to handle the data instead of array and object.
