# Tree
- A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
- In a tree each node is moving away from the root node i.e each node has distinct children.
- Tree has only one entry point i.e a root node

## Terminologies
1. `Root`: The top node in a tree. Each tree has only one node
2. `Child`: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
3. `Parent`: THe converse notion of a child
4. `Siblings`: A group of nodes with the same parent
5. `Leaf`: A node with no children
6. `Edge`: THe connection between one node and another

## Tree Vs List
